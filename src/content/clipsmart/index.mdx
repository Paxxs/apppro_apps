# ClipSmart

> A focused toolkit for working with text and screenshots on iPad and iPhone.  
> **Built 100% on iPad · Works fully offline · Privacy-friendly by design**


## What is ClipSmart?

**ClipSmart** is a small, fast utility that makes it easier to handle text and images on mobile:

- Text feels hard to select accurately?
- Screenshots are cluttered, but you only need one part?
- Need to pull key information from long paragraphs?
- Want a quick way to test every key on an external keyboard?

ClipSmart turns those everyday annoyances into quick, simple actions.

> 💡 The app itself was **developed entirely on iPad** using Swift Playgrounds—  
> no traditional computer involved at any stage.

All processing happens locally on your device.  
No servers, no accounts, no background syncing.


## Core Features

- **BigBang Editor** – Break text into pieces and rebuild only what you need  
- **BigBang Intelligence (Offline)** – Highlight contacts, addresses, links, and amounts automatically  
- **Image Clipper** – Draw a frame on an image to crop exactly that area  
- **Keyboard Test** – Press every key on your external keyboard and see what responds


## ✂️ BigBang Editor – A Better Way to Select Text

Text selection on mobile can be awkward and imprecise.  
**BigBang Editor** gives you a different workflow:

- Take a paragraph and instantly **“explode”** it into words and short phrases
- Tap the fragments you want and rebuild them into a fresh sentence, summary, or note
- Great for:
  - Pulling out key points from long content  
  - Creating quick summaries  
  - Studying and extracting important terms

No more fighting with long-press and drag handles just to select a few words.

## 🧠 BigBang Intelligence – Smart Recognition, Fully Offline

**BigBang Intelligence** scans text on your device and highlights useful items,  
with **no network connection required**.

It can automatically recognize:

- 👤 Contact information  
- 📍 Addresses  
- 🔗 URLs  
- 💰 Amounts and units  

Long-press a highlighted item to:

- Copy it  
- Open a link  
- Or use it in your workflow right away  

Everything is processed locally—your text never leaves your device.


## 🖼 Image Clipper – Draw a Box, Get a Crop

**Image Clipper** is designed for study and screenshot workflows.

- Draw a frame directly on an image to crop **exactly** that region
- The cropped result is **automatically copied to the clipboard**
- Select multiple areas in a row without constantly re-entering a crop mode

Perfect for:

- Capturing individual questions from a photo of an exam paper  
- Extracting specific slides or sections from presentation screenshots  
- Turning large, noisy screenshots into small, focused snippets

Compared to the standard crop flow, this can be several times faster.


## ⌨️ Keyboard Test – Quick Check for Every Key

If you use an external keyboard with your iPad (like Magic Keyboard),  
**Keyboard Test** gives you a simple way to verify that every key works.

- See key presses in real time as you type  
- Check for missing or unreliable keys  
- Useful when:
  - Testing a brand-new keyboard  
  - Inspecting a second-hand keyboard before you commit  
  - Troubleshooting a key you suspect is flaky


## 🔒 Fully Offline, Privacy-Respecting

ClipSmart is built for people who care about both **efficiency** and **privacy**.

- No login or account required  
- No data uploaded to servers  
- No dependence on a constant internet connection  
- All recognition, text handling, and image processing happens on-device

You can use ClipSmart comfortably even in airplane mode.


## 💻 Built 100% on iPad

ClipSmart is more than just a tool—it’s also a proof of concept:

- Designed, coded, and tested **entirely on iPad Pro**
- Written with **Swift Playgrounds**
- No desktop development environment used

You’re not just using an app on iPad;  
you’re using an app that was **created** on iPad.


## Who is ClipSmart for?

- 📚 **Students**  
  - Extract questions from exam photos  
  - Break down reading materials and highlight key points  

- 🧑‍💻 **Developers & power users**

- ✍️ **Heavy iPad / iPhone users**  
  - Regularly handle snippets of text, screenshots, links, and notes

ClipSmart is designed to slide naturally into that loop and make it smoother.
