# ClipSmart – Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how **ClipSmart** handles your data.  
ClipSmart is designed to work **entirely offline** and to respect your privacy by default.

By using ClipSmart, you agree to this Privacy Policy.


## 1. No Network Requests

ClipSmart does **not** make any network requests.

- The app does not connect to the internet.
- The app does not send any data to external servers.
- The app does not use cloud services or remote APIs.

All features work **locally on your device**, even when you are completely offline.


## 2. Information We Do **Not** Collect

ClipSmart does **not** collect, store, or transmit any of the following:

- No location data  
- No usage analytics or tracking data  
- No device identifiers  
- No advertising identifiers  
- No clipboard history on our servers (we have no servers)

We do not use third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools.


## 3. On-Device Processing

All content you work with in ClipSmart is processed **locally on your device**:

- Text used in **BigBang Editor** or **BigBang Intelligence** is handled in memory only for the purpose of providing the feature.
- Images used in **Image Clipper** are processed on-device and are not uploaded anywhere.
- Key presses used in **Keyboard Test** are read only to show you the key response; they are not logged or sent anywhere.

ClipSmart does not build a profile of you and does not attempt to identify you.


## 4. Data Storage and Retention

ClipSmart does **not** maintain its own online storage of your content.

- Any text, images, or data you create or copy using ClipSmart stay in:
  - Your device memory
  - Your system clipboard
  - Or other apps/locations where _you_ choose to paste or save them

We do not have access to, nor do we control, how your operating system or other apps handle this data.


## 5. Third-Party Services

ClipSmart does **not** integrate with third-party services for:

- Analytics  
- Advertising  
- Crash reporting  
- User tracking  

There are no embedded third-party SDKs that collect your data.


## 6. Children’s Privacy

Because ClipSmart does not collect personal information or connect to the internet,  
it is suitable for use by users of all ages, including children.

If you are a parent or guardian and have any concerns about your child’s use of ClipSmart,  
you may contact us using the details below.


## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will update the “Last updated” date at the bottom of this page.  
Any changes will apply to future versions of the app.

If ClipSmart ever introduces online features in the future, this policy will be updated to clearly describe what data is collected and how it is used.
